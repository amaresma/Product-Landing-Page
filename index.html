                Talisker distillery is an Island single malt Scotch whisky distillery based in Carbost, 
                Scotland on the Isle of Skye. The distillery is operated by Diageo, 
                and Talisker's 10 year old expression has been nominated as part of their Classic Malts series. 
                The brand is considered a premium Single Malt Whisky.
                The spirit is most frequently matured in American oak casks. The malt is peated to a phenol level 
                of approximately 18–22 parts per million (ppm), which is a medium peating level. Additionally, 
                the water used for production, from Cnoc nan Speireag (Hawk Hill), flows over peat which adds 
                additional complexity to the whisky.

                The distillery began producing special bottlings of the whisky for connoisseurs in the early 2000s, 
                with a 20- and 25-year bottling (where previously only a 10-year and 18-year were available). 
                The 25-year bottling, despite being more expensive than the 20-year bottling, 
                was distributed more widely.
                <br>
                In 2007 Talisker 18-year-old won "Best Single Malt In The World 2007" at the World Whiskies Awards 
                and in 2015 Talisker 10 Year Old won a Double Gold Medal and "Best Single Malt Scotch up to 12 years" 
                in the San Francisco World Spirits Competition.
